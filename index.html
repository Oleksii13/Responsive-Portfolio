            <p class="p-one">Hello, my name is Oleksii Nuzhdin. You can see me to the left of this text. As you can
                see,
                I was blonde last summer and I had longer hair than now. Yep, I made a short haircut,
                because I decided to save some times for practicing coding rather than washing my hair more often.
                Also, my quote of the life is "Good news everyone." This citation is from my favorite cartoon
                "Futurama".
                We have to have just good news and I am happy to share Good good news with everyone.
            </p>
            <p>I have started learning web programming to change the place of work and be more in touch with the
                future.
                I am speaking about the Internet. I think my WEB coding skills will make the Internet brighter And
                more responsive.
                So, you can find me on the Internet by going to <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=Oleksii+Nuzhdin&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA809CA809&oq=Oleksii+Nuzhdin&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.6886j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">
